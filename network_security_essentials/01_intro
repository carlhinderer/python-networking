- Eras of Information Security

    1. Before widespread use of data processing equipment, security of valuable information was provided by
         physical (ie locked file cabinets) and administrative (ie background checks) means.

    2. With the introduction of computers, files and other information stored on the computer needed to be
         protected.  This was especially true for time-shared systems and systems that could be accessed over
         a data network.  The collection of tools needed to protect data is known as 'computer security'.

    3. With the introduction of distributed systems and networks for carrying data between computers, data
         needed to be protected during transmission.  The tools used to ensure this is 'network security',
         and the tools used to protect an internet is 'internet security'.  Internet security is the focus of
         this book.



- The CIA Triad

    - Computer security has the objective of preserving confidentiality, integrity, and availability of 
        information system resources.


    - Confidentiality

        - 'Data confidentiality' assures that private or confidential information is not made available or
            disclosed to unauthorized individuals.

        - 'Privacy' assues that individuals control or influence what information related to them may be collected
            and stored, and to whom it may be disclosed.


    - Integrity

        - 'Data ingegrity' assues that data (both stored and transmitted) and programs are changed only in a
            specified and authorized manner.

        - 'System integrity' assures that a system performs it's intended function is an unimpaired manner, free
            from deliberate or unintended manipulation of the system.


    - Availability

        - This assures that systems work promptly and service is not denied to unauthorized users.


    - Authenticity

        - This is the property of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted.  We must have 
            confidence in the validity of a transmission, message, or message originator.  This means we must
            verify that users are who they say they are and that each input comes from a trusted source.


    - Accountability

        - This requires that actions of an entity can be traced uniquely to that identity.  We must be able to
            trace a security breach to a responsible party.  Systems must keep records to permit later forensic
            analysis.



- The OSI Security Architecture

    - ITU-T recommendation X.800 defines the OSI security architecture.  It is useful as a way to organize the
        task of providing security for an organization.


    - The OSI security architecture focuses on security attacks, mechanisms, and services.

        - Security attack = any action that compromises the security of information owned by an organization

        - Security mechanism = a process (or device incorporating a process) that is designed to detect, prevent, or
                                 recover from a security attack

        - Security service = a processing or communication service that enhances the security of the data processing
                               systems and information transfers of an organization, use one or more security
                               mechanisms to counter security attacks



- Security Attacks

    - Passive Attacks

        - Security attacks can be classified into active and passive attacks.  'Passive attacks' are in the nature of
            eavesdropping on or monitoring transmissions.

        - One type of passive attack is the 'release of message contents'.  An opponent learns the contents of
            confidential information from a phone call, email message, or transferred file.

        - Another type of passive attack is 'traffic analysis'.  For instance, an opponent could spy on traffic and
            learn the frequency of communication between parties.

        - Passive attacks are difficult to detect, since they do not involve altering data, so neither the sender or
            receiver is aware of any changes.  Passive attacks are dealt mainly with prevention, not detection.


    - Active Attacks

        - 'Active attacks' involve modification of the data stream (or creation of a false data stream).

        - A 'masquerade' takes place when one entity pretends to be a different entity.

        - A 'replay' involves the passive capture of a data unit and its subsequent retransmission to produce an
            unauthorized effect.

        - 'Modification of messages' means that some portion of a legitimate message is altered, or that messages are
            delayed or reordered.

        - The 'denial of service' prevents or inhibits the normal use of communication facilities.  This attack may
            have a specific target (ie suppress all messages to the security audit service) or may try to disrupt
            an entire network.

        - Active attacks are dealt with mainly by detecting them and attempting to recover from any disruption caused
            by them.



- Security Services

    - A security services is a service provided by a protocol layer of communicating open systems and that ensures
        adequate security of data transfers.  X.800 divides these services into 5 categories and 14 specific services.

        A. Authentication
             - Peer Entity Authentication
             - Data-Origin Authentication

        B. Access Control

        C. Data Confidentiality
            - Connection Confidentiality
            - Connectionless Confidentiality
            - Selective-Field Confidentiality
            - Traffic-Flow Confidentiality

        D. Data Integrity
            - Connection Integrity with Recovery
            - Connection Integrity without Recovery
            - Selective-Field Connection Recovery
            - Connectionless Integrity
            - Selective-Field Connectionless Recovery

        E. Nonrepudiation
            - Nonrepudiation, Origin
            - Nonrepudiation, Destination



- Authentication

    - The authentication service is concerned with assuring that a communication is authentic.

    - In the case of a single message, the function of the authentication service is to assure the recipient that
        the message is from the source it claims to be from.

    - In the case of an ongoing message, such as the connection of a terminal to a host, there are two aspects.
        First, the service assures that the 2 entities are authentic at connection initiation time.  Second, the
        service must assure that the connection is not interfered with by a third party.

    - 'Peer Entity Authentication' provides the corroboration of a peer identity in an association.  Peers are entities
        that implement the same protocol in different systems.  Peer entity is used at the establishment or during
        data transfer of a connection.  It attempts to provide confidence that an entity is not performing a
        masquerade or an authorized replay of a previous message.

    - 'Data Origin Authentication' provides for the corroboration of the source of a data unit.  This type of service
        supports applications like email, where there are no prior actions between communicating entities.



- Access Control

    - Access control is the ability to limit and control the access to host systems and applications via communication
        links.  Each identity must first be identified, or authenticated, so that access rights can be tailored to the
        individual.



- Data Confidentiality

    - Confidentiality is the protection of transmitted data from passive attacks.  It also protects traffic flow from
        analysis.

    - 'Connection Confidentiality' is the protection of all user data on a connection.  'Connectionless Confidentiality'
        is the protection of all user data in a single data block.

    - 'Selective-Field Confidentiality' protects seleted fields within the user data on a connection or in a single data
        block.

    - 'Traffic-Flow Confidentiality' protects information that might be derived from observation of traffic flows.



- Data Integrity

    - Data integrity can also apply to a stream of messages, a single message, or selected fields within a message.
        Again, the most useful and straightforward approach is total stream protection.

    - This service may or may not include recovery.  If a violation of integrity is detected, the service may just
        report the violation and move on, waiting for human intervention to recover.  Alternatively, mechanisms to 
        recover from the loss of integrity may be included.

    - 'Connection Integrity with Recovery' provides for the integrity of all user data on a connection and detects any
        modification, insertion, deletion, or replay of any data in an entire sequence, with recover attempted.
        'Connection Integrity without Recovery' is the same thing, but without recovery.

    - 'Selective-Field Connection Integrity' provides for the integrity of selected fields.

    - 'Connectionless Integrity' provides for the integrity of a single connectionless data block.  'Selective-Field
        Connectionless Integrity' provides for the integrity of selected fields in a single connectionless data block.



- Nonrepudiation

    - The nonrepudiation service prevents either sender or receiver from denying a transmitted message.  When a message
        is sent, the receiver can prove that the sender sent the message.  When a message is received, the sender can
        prove that the receiver received the message.



- Availability Service

    - Availability is the property of a system or resource being accessible by an authorized entity, according to 
        performance specifications for the system.  X.800 treats availability as a property associated with various
        security services, but it makes sense to call out a specific availability service if it prevents DoS attacks,
        for instance.



- Specific Security Mechanisms

    - Specific security mechanisms are implemented in a specific protocol layer, such as TCP or an application-layer
        protocol.


    - Encipherment

        This is the use of mathematical algorithms to transform data into a from that is not readily intelligible.  The
          transformation and subsequent recovery of the data depends on an algorithm and 0+ encryption keys.


    - Digital Signature

        This is data appended to, or a cryptographic transformation of, a data unit that allows a recipient of the data
          unit to prove the source and integrity of the data unit and protect against forgery.


    - Access Control

        This is a variety of measures that enforce access rights to resources.


    - Data Integrity

        This is a variety of mechanisms used to assure the integrity of a data unit or stream of data units.


    - Authentication Exchange

        This is a mechanism used to ensure the identity of an entity by means of information exchange.


    - Traffic Padding

        This is the insertion of bits into gaps in a data stream to frustrate traffic analysis attempts.


    - Routing Control

        This enables selection of particular physically secure routes for certain data and allows routing changes,
          especially if a breach is suspected.


    - Notarization

        This is the use of a trusted third party to assure certain properties of a data exchange.



- Pervasive Security Mechanisms

    - Pervasive security mechanisms are not specific to any particular protocol layer or security service.


    - Trusted Functionality

        This is functionality that is perceived to be correct with respect to some criteria (ie a security policy).


    - Security Label

        This is the marking bound to a resource (ie a data unit) that names or designates the security attributes of
          the resource.


    - Event Detection

        This is the detection of security-relevant events.


    - Security Audit Trail

        This is data collected to facilitate a security audit.


    - Security Recovery

        This deals with requests from mechanisms and takes recovery actions.



- Fundamental Security Design Principles

    1. Economy of Mechanism

         The design of security measures in hardware and software should be as simple and small as possible.  This
           makes it easier to test and verify thoroughly.


    2. Fail-safe Defaults

         Access decisions should be based on permission rather than exclusion.  The default should be a lack of access.
           For example, most file access systems work on this principle.


    3. Complete Mediation

         Every access must be checked against the access control mechanism.  Systems should not rely on decisions
           retrieved from a cache.  If access decisions are cached, careful considerations should be given to how
           changes are propogated into caches.


    4. Open Design

         Design of a security mechanism should be open rather than secret.  Encryption keys are secret, but algorithms
           are open to public scrutiny.


    5. Separation of Privilege

         Multiple privelege attributes are required to achieve access to a restricted resource.  Two-factor authentication
           is an example of this.


    6. Least Privilege

         Every process and every user should operate using the last set of privileges necessary to perform a task.
           RBAC is an example of this.  Also, administrators who have special privileges should only have those
           privileges when necessary.  When doing ordinary activities, those privileges should be withdrawn.


    7. Least Common Mechanism

         The functions shared by different users should be minimized.  This helps reduce the number of unintended
           communication paths and reduces the amount of hardware and software on which all users depend.


    8. Psychological Acceptability

         Security mechanisms should not interfere with the work of users.  Where possible, mechanisms should be
           transparent to users.  Also, security mechanisms should make sense to users.


    9. Isolation

         Isolation is a principle that applies in 3 contexts.

           A. Public access systems should be isolated from critical resources.  If the sensitivity of data is high,
                you may want to ensure no physical connection exists.  If using logical isolation, layers of security
                services and mechanisms should be established.

           B. Processes and files of individual users should be isolated from one another.  All modern OS's provide
                facilities for such isolation.

           C. Security mechanisms themselves should be isolated from access to them.  For example, cryptographic
                software and keys should be kept apart from the rest of the system.


    10. Encapsulation

          Collections of procedures and objects should be hidden in an internal structure with only designated domain
            entry points available.


    11. Modularity

          Security functions should be developed as separate, protected modules.  Each security mechanism should support
            migrating specific components without an entire system redesign.


    12. Layering

          Multiple, overlapping protection addresses the people, technology, and operational aspects of information
            systems.  This way, failure of an individual approach won't leave the system unprotected.  This is often
            referred to as 'defense in depth'.


    13. Least Astonishment

          A program or UI should always respond in a way that is least likely to astonish the user.



- Attack Surfaces

    - An attack surface consists of the reachable and exploitable vulnerabilities in a system.


    - Common examples include:

        - Open ports on outward facing web and other servers, and code listening on those ports

        - Services available on the inside of a firewall

        - Code that processes incoming data, email, XML, office documents, other exchange formats

        - Interfaces, SQL, web forms

        - An employee with access to sensitive information


    - Attack surfaces can be categorized as network attack surfaces, software attack surfaces, or human attack
        surfaces.

    - Identifying attack surfaces is useful for figuring out where security mechanisms are required.  Security
        designers want to make the attack surface as small as possible.



- Attack Trees

    - An attack tree is a branching, hierarchical data structure that represents a set of potential techniques for
        exploiting security vulnerabilities.  The root is the overall objective of the attack, and each path can be
        taken to achieve the objective.


    - For example, an attacker wants to compromise a bank account.  There are 3 components involved in authentication
        in this system:

        1. User terminal and user
        2. Communications channel
        3. Internet banking server


    - Five overall attack strategies can be identified:

        1. User credential compromise
        2. Injection of commands
        3. User credential guessing
        4. Security policy violation (by a bank employee)
        5. Use of known authenticated session



- A Model For Network Security

    - In general terms, the model for this book is that a message needs to be transferred from one party (principal)
        to another across some sort of Internet service.  A logical information channel is established through the
        Internet by the cooperative use of TCP/IP.


    - All of the techniques for providing security have 2 components:

        1. A security-related transformation on the information to be sent
        2. Some secret information shared by the principals but unknown to the opponent


    - A trusted third party may be needed to achieve secure transmission.  For example, the third party may be
        responsible for distributing the secret information to the two principals.  Or the third party may need to
        arbitrate disputes between the 2 principals concerning the authenticity of a message transmission.


    - This general model shows that there are 4 basic tasks in designing a particular security service:

        1. Design an algorithm for performing the security-related transformation
        2. Generate the secret information to be used with the algorithm
        3. Develop methods for the distribution and sharing of the secret information
        4. Specify a protocol to be used by the 2 principals to make use of the security algorithm and secret information


    - Chapters 2-9 in this book follow this general model.  Chapters 10-12 look at system security concerns such as 
        protecting against worms, viruses, and other similar attacks.



- Standards

    - The NIST is a US federal agency that deals with measurement science, standards, and technology related to US
        government use and promotion of US private-sector innovation.

    - The ISOC (Internet Society) is a professional membership society with worldwide membershipt.  It provides
        leadership for groups such as the IETF and IAB.  These organizations develop Internet standards and related
        specs that are published as RFCs.
