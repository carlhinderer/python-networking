- Let's Meet Some Nice People

    Bob                    Alice
    ------------        ----------------
    -A-> hello             hello
         ALICE             ALICE
           |                 ^
           V                 |

- People with Bad Intent

    - Carol, Carlos or Charlie, as a third participant in communications.

    - Chuck, as a third participant usually of malicious intent

    - Dan or Dave, a fourth participant

    - Eve, an eavesdropper, is usually a passive attacker. While she can listen in on 
        messages between Alice and Bob, she cannot modify them.


- Paranoia

    - Who is out to get you?

    - If you are interesting or influential people want to get into your personal info.

    - If you are normal, folks want to use your resources or take your information to 
        make money...

    - Usually no one cares...  But it is safest to assume some is always trying...


- Security is always a Tradeoff

    - "Perfect security" is unachievable - Must find the right tradeoff

    - Security versus Cost

    - Security versus Convenience (See also, "profit")

    - "More" is not always better â€“ vendors of products will try to convince you that you 
        *cannot live* without their particular gadget


- Terminology

    - Confidentiality
        - Prevent unauthorized viewing of private information

    - Integrity
        - Information is from who you think it is from and has not been modified since it 
            was sent
