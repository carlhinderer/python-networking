- Let's Meet Some Nice People

    Bob                    Alice
    ------------        ----------------
    -A-> hello             hello
         ALICE             ALICE
           |                 ^
           V                 |
      x0Ak3o$2Rj  -->   x0Ak3o$2Rj  <-A-


- People with Bad Intent

    - Carol, Carlos or Charlie, as a third participant in communications.

    - Chuck, as a third participant usually of malicious intent

    - Dan or Dave, a fourth participant

    - Eve, an eavesdropper, is usually a passive attacker. While she can listen in on 
        messages between Alice and Bob, she cannot modify them.


- Paranoia

    - Who is out to get you?

    - If you are interesting or influential people want to get into your personal info.

    - If you are normal, folks want to use your resources or take your information to 
        make money...

    - Usually no one cares...  But it is safest to assume some is always trying...


- Security is always a Tradeoff

    - "Perfect security" is unachievable - Must find the right tradeoff

    - Security versus Cost

    - Security versus Convenience (See also, "profit")

    - "More" is not always better â€“ vendors of products will try to convince you that you 
        *cannot live* without their particular gadget


- Terminology

    - Confidentiality
        - Prevent unauthorized viewing of private information

    - Integrity
        - Information is from who you think it is from and has not been modified since it 
            was sent

|  PART 2 - ENCRYPTION & CONFIDENTIALITY                              |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Terminology

    - Plaintext is a message that will be put into secret form.

    - Ciphertext is a transformed version of plaintext that is unintelligible to anyone 
        without the means to decryptTerminology

    - The transformation of plaintext to ciphertext is referred to as encryption.

    - Returning the ciphertext back to plaintext is referred to as decryption.

    - The strength of a cryptosystem is determined by the encryption and decryption 
        techniques and the length of the key.


- Two Kinds of Systems

    - Two basic types of cryptosystems exist, secret-key and public-key.

    - In a secret-key scheme, the key used for encryption must be the same key used for 
        decryption.  Also called symmetric-key cryptosystem.

    - Secret-key cryptosystems have the problem of secure key distribution to all parties 
        using the cryptosystem.


- Secret-Key Scheme


      Plaintext:           c = d           Plaintext:
      "candy"              a = b           "candy"
                           n = o
      Encrypt              d = e           Decrypt
                           y = z

      CipherText:      Message Might       CipherText:
      "dboez"          Be Intercepted      "dboez"

      Alice                 Eve              Bob



- Caesar Cipher

    - Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 

    - It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 
        replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

        A B C
        | | |
        V V V    shift of 3
        D E F


- Example - Break the Code 1

    CipherText: "upbtu"

    Strategy:
      - Use the decoder ring.
      - For each number 1..26, see if when you decrypt the message with that shift, it 
          makes sense.

    PlainText: "toast" (Shift of 1)


- Example - Break the Code 2

    CipherText: "Uryyb, zl anzr vf Puhpx naq V arrq zbarl naq n wrg."

    Strategy:
      - We know the message is in English.
      - We use the 'V' -> 'I' and 'n' -> a to get the shift of 13.

    PlainText: "Hello, my name is Chuck and I need money and a jet."
