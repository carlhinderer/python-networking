-----------------------------------------------------------------------
|  PHASE 1 - DAWN OF ELECTRONIC COMPUTING                             |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- War Time Computing - Alan Turing and Bletchley Park

    - Top secret code-breaking effort
    - 10,000 people at the peak
    - BOMBE = mechanical computer
    - Colossus = Electronic computer


- Post-war (1940s)

    - Alumni of US and UK codebreaking efforts start building general purpose computers
    - Manchester Baby
    - Ferranti Mark I
    - Harvard Mark I
    - US Army ENIAC


- Post-war (1950s)

    - Math and science won the war
    - Broad-based investment by US and west in maintaining technical lead
    - Mathematicians were valued and recruited


- John Forbes Nash

    - PHD from Princeton in 1950 at 22 years old
    - Math faculty at MIT (1951-58)
    - Schizophrenia (1959-95)
    - Nobel Prize in Economics (1994)





-----------------------------------------------------------------------
|  PHASE 2 - PRE-INTERNET COMMUNICATION                               |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Dial-Up Access

    - It was a big improvement to having to walk to the computer itself!
    - You could 'call' other computers using long distance
    - Characters were encoded as sound
    - Pretty common in the 1970s


- Data Transfer with Leased Lines

    - Dedicated connection between 2 points from the phone company
    - No dialing was needed since leased lines were always connected
    - Reserved dedicated phone wires and permanent connections
    - Expensive because of limited copper, and based on distance
    - Bank branch offices and other places where cost is significant


- Store and forward networking (Example - BITNET)

    - Typically specialized in mail
    - Email could make it across the country in 6 hrs to 2 days
    - You generally focused your life on 1 computer
    - Money was saved by adding more hops
    - Early 1980s





-----------------------------------------------------------------------
|  PHASE 3 - RESEARCH NETWORKS - 1960s & 1970s                        |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Research Networks (1960-1980s)

    - Done by ARPA for military uses
    - How can we avoid having direct connections between all pairs of computers?
    - How can we dynamically handle outages switching between multiple paths?
    - How to transport many messages simultaneously and efficiently?


- Packet Switching - Efficient Message Transmission

    - The problem: in store and forward, large messages block small ones
    - The solution is to break each message into packets
    - We can allow the packets from a single message to travel over different paths
    - We use special computers called 'routers' for traffic control (only forward, don't store)


- Packet Switching Example - Postcards

    Message: Hello there, have a nice day.

    Packet 1:
    Hello ther (1, csev, daphne)

    Packet 2:
    e, have a  (2, csev, daphne)

    Packet 3:
    nice day.  (3, csev, daphne)


- Example Problem to Solve

    - With each router having only a local knowledge of the shape of the network, how do
        we avoid things like cycles?

    - Problems like this took 20 years and 4 rewrites of ARPA to solve.





-----------------------------------------------------------------------
|  PHASE 4 - THE FIRST INTERNET - MID 1980s                           |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Supercomputers

    - Science needed faster computers, and universities started asking for their own supercomputers
    - The NSF decided to buy a few supercomputers and connect them on a network


- NCSA - Innovation

    - The internet and the web are assumed now, but it was not easy to implement
    - A number of breakthroughs came from the NCSA in Urbana-Champaign
    - High-performance computing and the internet were deeply linked


- NSFNet

    - Funded by the NSF
    - Standardized on TCP/IP (which was created by ARPAnet)
    - The first national TCP/IP network that was "inclusive"
    - Initial goal was all research universities


- NSF Net Advocacy

    - Initially aimed at research universities
    - Cleveland FreeNet and similar efforts provided indirect Internet access to average citizens
    - In 1989-90, "academic-only" started being relaxed, and ISPs started making 'dial-up' available





-----------------------------------------------------------------------
|  PHASE 5 - THE WEB MAKES IT EASY - EARLY 1990s                      |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- CERN - High-Energy Physics

    - Brilliant physicists from all over the world
    - Work on long, detailed projects (15-20 years)
    - Have a lot of time to think


- The Beginning of the Web - CERN

    - The internet was infrastructure, the web gave it a UI and URLs
    - The web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Caillau (1990)
    - CERN developed browsers and servers with a goal of worldwide hyperlinked articles


- The First Web Server in America

    - The first web server in America was at the Stanford Linear Accellerator (SLAC)
    - It was a research database of 300,000 research papers
    - Dr Paul Kunz
    - December 12, 1991


- Gopher is Dominant in 1993

    - IETF (Internet Engineering Taks Force) Meeting
        - March 29 - April 2, 1993 in Columbus, OH (638 attendees)
        - Gopher BOF (200 attendees)
        - WWW BOF (15 attendees including Tim Berners-Lee)

    - DVD is also invented this year


- Steve Jobs and the WWW?

    - For several years, the primary web browser and web server were NeXT applications
    - Apple computers provided far superior graphics that allowed the development of Mosaic


- The Explosive Growth of the Web

    - The web was invented in the early 1990s
    - Growing in academia (1993)
    - Growing everywhere (1994-95)
    - Cable modems to the home started in the mid 90s


- Mosaic - Netscape - Mozilla - Firefox

    - Mosaic was the first 'consumer' web browser, developed at NCSA
        (by Marc Andreesen and Eric Bina)

    - Mosaic was open source, and worked on Mac/Windows/Unix
    - NCSA created the httpd web server, which became Apache

    - While most of the NCSA programmers formed Netscape and made fortunes, NCSA released their
        browser for free and focused on building standards to keep the web open





-----------------------------------------------------------------------
|  PHASE 6 - THE UBIQUITY OF THE INTERNET - 1996 TO PRESENT           |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- 1994: The Year of the Web

    - Netscape founded (April 1994)
    - WWW Conference at CERN (May 1994)
    - WWW Conference in Chicago (October 1994)
    - Tim Berners-Lee founds the W3C at MIT (October 1994)
    - Windows 95 Beta 2 (November 1994)


- Netscape, JavaScript, and Firefox

    - As Microsoft worked to suffocate Netscape:

         - JavaScript was invented to compete with Visual Basic (1995)
         - Netscape slowly leaked out into open source as Mozilla (late 90s)

    - Firefox was released in November 2004
    - Firefox's search box gave the small Mozilla foundation millions in revenue


- Brendan Eich and JavaScript

    - Written as an alternative to Java applets, was meant to be for people who didn't know
        how to use a compiler.  Was meant to compete with Visual Basic.

    - Since it was rushed, it was made to be malleable, which allowed other people to build
        toolkits on top of it.

    - Included things like first-class functions and prototypal inheritance.  It was rushed, so
        it didn't include advanced features like OOP.

    - In the mid 90s, it got a bad reputation, since it was used for things like annoying pop-ups.
        Firefox eventually led things like automatically supressing them.  This eventually led
        to a resurgence in JavaScript, which led to Web 2.0's rich clients.

    - Google released the V8 engine in 2008.


- Did Microsoft Save the World-Wide Web?

    - Netscape wanted to make the web browser, web server, and web protocols proprietary
        and owned by them

    - The web browser would be $50-$100 and sold separately
    - This threatened to make the desktop OS irrelevant


- World-Wide-Web Consortium (W3C)

    - The W3C was formed in October 1994
    - Led by Tim Berners-Lee, who moved from CERN to MIT
    - Goal was to develop standards to avoid proprietary balkanization of the web
    - Many large companies (IBM, Microsoft, etc.) joined quickly


- When You Can Assume the Web

    - Larry Smarr wanted to make supercomputers available to physicists
    - UM sneaked in 1.54Mb/sec instead of 56kb/sec backbone for their NSFNet proposal
    - Tim Berners-Less and Robert Cailliau were building a system for network hosted documentation
    - Paul Kunz was trying to make his article database easier to use
    - Joseph Hardin wanted to make supercomputers more user friendly
    - Mitchell Baker - Just wanted us to have a free and open source browser


- The Web Land Rush

    - In the late 90s, fortunes were made by simply being first in a market
    - Everything was novel when it was re-invented on the web
    - New brands were quickly established and became dominant


- The Modern Internet

    - In the late 90s, a ton of fiber optic was installed in the USA
    - High speed and long distance were cheap and common
    - Many national backbone networks emerged - commercial, government, academic, etc.
    - These networks swap data at 'peering points' - after about 1999, this was all seamless
