|  LAYER 1 - THE LINK LAYER                                           |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- From Store and Forward to Routers

    - In order to keep costs low and connections geographically short, data will be
        forwarded through several routers.

    - Getting across the country usually takes about 10 hops.

    - Network designers continually add and remove links to 'tune' their networks.


- Layered Network Model

    - A layered approach allows the problem of designing networks to be broken up into parts.

    - This is known as the TCP/IP protocol suite.  The 7-layer OSI model was also used.

        Application Layer    [Web, Email, File Transfer]
        Transport Layer      [Reliable Connections]
        Internetwork Layer   [Simple, Unreliable]
        Link Layer           [Ethernet, Wifi]


- Internet Standards

    - The standards for all of the Internet protocols are developed by the IETF
    - Standards are called RFCs (Requests for Comments)


- Layered Architecture

    - The Physical and Internet layers are like trucks and trains - they haul stuff to the
        correct loading docks, and it takes multiple steps.

    - The Transport layer checks to see if the trucks made it and send the stuff again if
        necessary.

- The Link Layer (aka The Physical Layer)

    - As your data crosses the country, it may use a different physical medium for each hop.
    - The medium could be Wire, Wireless, Fiber Optic, etc.
    - The link is one 'hop' - Is it up or down?  Is it connected?
    - Has a very narrow focus, no view of the whole internet
    - Just gets data across the wire from one computer to another


- Problems Solved by the Link Layer

    - How does the data get pushed onto a link?
    - How is the link shared?

    - Common Link Technologies
        - Ethernet
        - WiFi
        - Cable Modem
        - DSL
        - Satellite
        - Optical


- Link Layer Addresses

    - Many physical layer devices have addresses built into them by the manufacturer
        (ie Ethernet and WiFi)

    - Physical addresses allow systems to identify themselves on the ends of a single link
        (in case they are shared, for instance on a hub)

    - Physical addresses go no further than one link

    - Sometimes links like WiFi and wired Ethernet are shared with multiple computers


- Sharing Nicely - Avoiding Chaos

    - CSMA/CD = Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection

    - To avoid garbled messages, systems must observer "rules" (protocols)

    - Ethernet rules are simple

        1. Wait for silence
        2. Begin transmitting data
        3. Listen for your own data
        4. If you cannot hear your own data clearly, assume a collision, wait and try again
        5. Each system waits a different time to avoid "too much politeness"


- Ethernet

    - Invented by Robert Metcalf at Xerox PARC (1973)
    - The first Local-Area-Network
    - Connected PCs to laser printer (the first laser printer)
    - Inspired by an earlier wireless network called 'Aloha' at University of Hawaii
    - Computers connected to a single coaxial cable using vampire taps





-----------------------------------------------------------------------
|  LAYER 2 - THE INTERNET PROTOCOL                                    |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Internet Protocol Layer

    - Goal: Gets your data from this computer to other computer halfway around the
        world.  

    - Each router knows about nearby routers.

    - IP is best effort.  It's OK to drop data if things go bad.


- IP Addresses

    - The IP address is the worldwide number which is associated with one particular 
        workstation or server

    - Every system which will send packets directly out across the Internet must have 
        a unique IP address

    - IP addresses are based on where station is connected

    - IP addresses are not controlled by a single organization - address ranges are 
        assigned

    - They are like phone numbers – they get reorganized once in a great while


- IP Address Format

    - Four numbers with dots - each number 1-255 (32 bits)

    - Kind of like phone numbers with an “area code”

    - The prefix of the address is “which network”

    - While the data is traversing the Internet - all that matters is the network 
        number

        141.211.144.188
        141.211.*.*


- Router Tables

    - No single router knows the whole network, just which way to send data to get it
        'closer'.

    - Router tables are lists of where to send packets, based on:
        - destination network address
        - bandwidth on adjacent links
        - traffic on adjacent links
        - state of neighbor nodes (up or not)


- IP is Simple

    - Local network connects to 100s of servers
    - Must support thousands of network connections, billions of bytes of data per second
    - Thousands of user systems on each segment


- DHCP

    - The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

    - When a host joins the network, it asks for the router

    - Router returns an IP address that can be used for communications


- Non-Routable Addresses

    - A typical home router does NAT (Network Address Translation)

    - Your ISP gives your home router a real global routable address

    - Your router gives out local addresses in a special range (192.168.*.*)

    - The router maps remote addresses for each connection you make from within 
        your home network


- Peering into the Internet

    - Most systems have a command that will reveal the route taken across the internet 
        (traceroute on Mac and tracert on Windows)

        $ traceroute www.stanford.edu

    - Each IP packet has a field called “Time to Live”, TTL, that gets decremented on each hop

    - The TTL is used to deal with loops in the network - normally if routers got confused 
        and ended up with a loop - the network would clog up rapidly.


- How Traceroute Works

    - Normal packets are sent with a Time to Live (TTL) of 255 hops

    - Trace route sends a packet with TTL=1, TTL=2, ...

    - So each packet gets part-way there and then gets dropped and traceroute gets a 
        notification of where the drop happens

    - This builds a map of the nodes that a packet visits when crossing the Internet.


- The Perfect is the Enemy of the Good

    - IP Does: Best effort to get data across bunch of hops from one network to another 
        network

    - IP Does Not: Guarantee delivery - if things go bad - the data can vanish

    - Best effort to keep track of the good and bad paths for traffic - tries to pick better 
        paths when possible

    - This makes it fast and scalable to very large networks - and ultimately “reliable” 
        because it does not try to do too much


- Vint Cerf

    - Instrumental in the design and development of the ARPANET

    - Vint was a graduate student as the notions of packet-switching were emerging across 
        academia


- Domain Name System

    - Numeric addresses like 141.211.63.45 are great for Internet routers but lousy for 
        people

    - Each campus ends up with a lot of networks (141.211.*.*, 65.43.21.*)

    - Sometimes (rarely) the IP address numbers get reorganized

    - When servers physically move they need new IP addresses


- DNS: Internet Address Book

    - The Domain Name System is a big fast distributed database of Internet names to 
        Internet “phone numbers”

    - IP Addresses reflect technical “geography”
        141.211.63.44 - read left to right like a phone number

    - Domain names reflect organizational structure
        www.si.umich.edu - read right to left like postal address
        2455 North Quad, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, Earth


- Domain Name Space

    - / root
        > .org
        > .edu
        > .com
        > .nl

|  LAYER 3 - TCP                                                      |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Review: The Magic of IP

    - What it does - Tries to get one packet across a 5-20 of hops from one network 
        to another network

    - Keeps track of the good and bad paths for traffic - tries to pick better paths 
        when possible

    - But no guarantee of delivery - if things go bad - the data vanishes

    - This makes it fast and scalable - and ultimately “reliable” because it does not 
        try to do too "everything"


- Internet Protocol

    - So many links/hops

    - So many routes

    - Things can change dynamically and IP has to react (ie links up or down)

    - IP can drop packets


- TCP (Transmission Protocol)

    - Built on top of IP

    - Assumes IP might lose some data

    - In case data gets lost - we keep a copy of the data we send until we get an 
        acknowledgement

    - If it takes “too long” - just send it again

    - Billions of computers connected to the internet; 100 thousands of routers. Hundreds 
        of billions bytes of data enroute at any moment.Storage  of enroute data done at 
        the edges only!

    - The responsibility of the transport layer is to present a reliable end-to-end pipe 
        to the application

    - Data either arrives in the proper order or the connection is closed

    - TCP keeps buffers in the sending and destination system to keep data which has arrived 
        out of order or to retransmit if necessary

    - TCP provides individual connections between applications


- One Scary Problem

    - Many people (especially companies like AT&T and DEC) believed the internet would collapse,
        and that a network designed by a bunch of academics was likely to fail

    - In 1987, local campuses with 10 MBit networks were connected using 56Kbit leased lines,
        and things started to fall apart.

    - Van Jacobson wrote several patches which drastically reduced congestion on the networks.

    - Today, his 'slow start' algorithm is know as the TCP Congestion Avoidance Algorithm.

|  LAYER 4 - THE APPLICATION LAYER                                    |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Quick Review

    - Link layer:  gets the data onto the link, and manages collisions on a single hop

    - Internet layer: moves the data over one hop, trying to get it “closer” to its destination

    - Transport layer: Assumes that the internet layer may lose data, so request retransmission 
        when needed—provides a nice reliable pipe from source to destination


- Application Protocol

    - Since TCP gives us a reliable pipe, what to we want to do with the pipe?  What problem do 
        we want to solve?

        - Mail
        - World Wide Web
        - Stream kitty videos


- Two Questions for the Application Layer

    1. Which application gets the data?
         - Ports

    2. What are the rules for talking with that application?
         - Protocols


- Ports

    - Like extensions in a phone number

    - The IP address network number (the area code) gets to the LAN

    - The IP address host number (the telephone number) gets you to the destination machine

    - The port (the extension) gets you to a specific application


- Common TCP Ports

    - Common TCP Ports

        - Telnet (23) - Login
        - SSH (22) - Secure Login

        - HTTP (80)
        - HTTPS (443) - Secure

        - SMTP (25) (Mail)
        - IMAP (143/220/993) - Mail Retrieval
        - POP (109/110) - Mail Retrieval

        - DNS (53) - Domain Name
        - FTP (21) - File Transfer


- HTTP - Hypertext Transport Protocol

    - The dominant Application Layer Protocol on the Internet

    - Invented for the Web - to Retrieve HTML,  Images, Documents etc

    - Extended to be data in addition to documents - RSS, Web Services, etc..

    - Basic Concept - Make a Connection - Request a document - Retrieve the Document - 
        Close the Connection


- Internet Standards

    - The standards for all of the Internet protocols (inner workings) are developed by an 
        organization

    - Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
        www.ietf.org

    - Standards are called “RFCs” - “Request for Comments”


- The Internet: An Amazing Design

    - Hundreds of millions of computers
    - Thousands of routers inside the Internet
    - Hundreds of millions of simultaneous connections
    - Trillions of bytes of data moved per second around the world
    - And it works


- The Internet

    - It is said that “The Internet is the largest single engineering effort ever created by 
        mankind”

    - It was created to work in an organic way - to repair itself and automatically adjust 
        when parts fail

    - No one part of the Internet knows all of the Internet (like life)

    - It is never 100% up - but it seems up all the time
