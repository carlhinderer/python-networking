    - NAT allows computers on a network to use IP addresses that are invalid for use on
        the internet and can be used only on private networks.

    - Tips for securing routers:

        1. Install updates
        2. Change the default admin pw
        3. Change the default SSID
        4. Use at least WPA2 for encryption
        5. Create a strong password for connecting to the network
        6. Disable old WiFi protocols (ie 802.11b/g)
        7. Enable MAC address filtering
        8. Disable remote access
        9. (Maybe) turn off DHCP and assign static addresses
        10. Create a Guest network separate from your private network
