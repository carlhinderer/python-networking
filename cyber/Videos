- Worms

    - Worm Propogation

        1. Find a target
        2. Copy worm to target
        3. Remote execution on target

    - Morris worm of 1988 (99-line program) brought entire internet down


- Trojan Horse Login Program

    - Looks like one thing, but is actually something different

    - Trap Door

        if password == stored_password or password == 'abc123':
            login()...

    - Possible Fixes:

       A. Testing the software
       B. Code review
       C. Process compliance


- Malicious Compiler Program

    - Ken Thompson came up with the idea that a trap door could evade being detected by code review
        if you create the trap door in the compiler.

    - "You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself."
          - Ken Thompson

    - One solution might be to make compiler providers sign legal contract stating they don't have
        trap doors like this present.


- Typical Unix Kernel Attack

    - Using 'Unix' as a generic term for the entire family of Unix-like systems (Linux, OSX, Android, etc.)

    - Typical Attack

        1. The "IFS" (input field separator) variable defines which characters can be used as separators
             in commands (usually a space is used).

           We want to set the IFS variable to include both space and slash (' /').
           So, "/etc/file" is the same as "etc file".


        2. Find a setuid-to-root program

           Allows normal user root access


        3. Find an open source program that has a 'setuid-to-root' critical section

           For example, maybe the region includes 'exec /etc/protect/file'

           See the 'at' command


        4. Unix Shell Program - /bin/sh

           Allows copying ("cp /bin/sh hackshell") the kernel to your user directory

           The copied program inherits privileges


    - In summary,

        1. Change internal field separator
        2. Copy UNIX shell
        3. Run setuid program
        4. Copy shell
