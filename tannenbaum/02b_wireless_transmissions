- The Electromagnetic Spectrum

    - When electrons move, they create electromagnetic waves that can propogate through space, even in a
        vacuum.  These waves were predicted by James Clerk Maxwell in 1865 and first observed by Heinrich
        Hertz in 1887.  The number of oscillations per second of a wave is called its 'frequency' (measured
        in Hz).  The distance between 2 consecutive maxima (or minima) is called the 'wavelength'.  By
        convention, frequency is denoted f and wavelength is denoted lambda.

    - When an antenna is attached to an electrical circuit, the electromagnetic waves can be broadcast
        efficiently and received by a receiver some distance away.  All wireless communication is based on
        this principle.

    - In a vacuum, all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed, no matter what their frequency.  This
        speed is known as the 'speed of light' (3*10^8 m/s, denoted c).  In a vacuum, f * lambda = c.
        Since c is a constant, we can find f from lambda or lambda from f.


    - The electromagnetic spectrum:

        10^0  - 10^4  Hz
        10^4  - 10^8  Hz   = Radio
        10^8  - 10^11 Hz   = Microwave
        10^11 - 10^14 Hz   = Infrared
        10^14 - 10^16 Hz   = Visible Light and UV
        10^16 - 10^22 Hz   = X-Ray
        10^22 +            = Gamma ray


    - ITU-T Bands

        10^4  - 10^5  Hz   = LF   (Twisted pair, Maritime)
        10^5  - 10^6  Hz   = MF   (Twisted pair, Coax, Maritime, AM Radio)
        10^6  - 10^7  Hz   = HF   (Twisted pair, Coax, AM Radio)
        10^7  - 10^8  Hz   = VHF  (Twisted pair, Coax, FM Radio, TV)
        10^8  - 10^9  Hz   = UHF  (Twisted pair, Coax, FM Radio, TV)
        10^9  - 10^10 Hz   = SHF  (Satellite and Terrestrial Microwave)
        10^10 - 10^11 Hz   = EHF  (Satellite and Terrestrial Microwave)
        ...
        10^14 - 10^15      = Fiber Optics


    - The radio, microwave, infrared, and visible light portions can all be used for transmitting data by
        modulating the amplitude, frequency, or phase of the waves.  The higher bands would be even better
        due to higher frequencies, but they are had to produce and modulate, do not propogate well through
        buildings, and are dangerous to living things.

    - The theoretical basis for communication tells us that the amount of information a signal such as
        an electromagnetic wave can carry depends on received power and is proportional to its bandwidth.

    - Most transmissions use a relatively narrow frequency band and concentrate signal power in this 
        narrow band to use the spectrum efficiently.  However, there are 3 types of transmission that make
        use of wider frequency bands - Frequency Hopping Spream Spectrum, Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum,
        and Ultra-Wideband.



- Frequency Hopping Spream Spectrum

    - In 'frequency hopping spread spectrum', a transmitter hops from frequency to frequency hundreds of
        times per second.  

    - It is popular for military communication because it makes transmission hard to detect and almost 
        impossible to jam.

    - It also offers resistance to narrowband interference, because the receiver will not be stuck on an
        impaired frequency long enough to shut down communication.  This technique is widely used in 
        Bluetooth and older versions of 802.11.



- Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum

    - 'Direct sequence spread spectrum' uses a code sequence to spread the data signal over a wider 
        frequency band.  It is widely used to let multiple signals share the same frequency band.  These
        signals can be given different codes, a method called 'Code Division Multiple Access'.

    - This method forms the basis of 3G mobile phone networks and is also used in GPS.



- Ultra-Wideband Communication

    - 'UWB' communication sends a series of low-energy rapid pulses, varying their carrier frequences to
        communicate information.  The rapid transitions lead to a signal that is spread out over a very
        wide frequency band.

    - Since it is spread across a large range of frequencies, it can tolerate a relatively strong
        interference from other narrowband signals.  Also, since it uses very little energy at any given
        frequency, it doesn't cause harmful interference to other narrowband signals.

    - This is popular for short-distance indoor applications, as well as precision radar imaging and
        location-tracking technologies.



- Radio Transmission

    - Radio frequency (RF) waves are easy to generate, can travel long distances, and can penetrate buildings
        easily, so they are widely used for communications, both indoors and outdoors.  Radio waves are
        omnidirectional, so the transmitter and receiver do not need to be carefully aligned physically.

    - The properties of radio waves are frequency dependent.  At low frequencies, they pass through objects
        well, but power falls off sharply with distance from the source.  This attenuation is called
        'path loss'.  At high frequencies, radio waves tend to travel in a straight line and bounce off 
        of obstacles.

    - At all frequencies, radio waves are subject to interference from motors and other electrical
        equipment.

    - Radio waves can travel long distances, which makes interference between users a problem.  For this
        reason, all governments tightly regulate the use of radio transmitters.

    - In the VLF, LF, and MF bands, radio waves follow the ground.  These waves can be detected for
        perhaps 1000 km in the lower frequencies, less in the higher ones.  AM radio broadcasting uses the
        MF band, which is why the signals travel a long distance.  Radio waves in these bands pass
        through buildings easily.

    - In the HF and VHF bands, the ground waves tend to be absorbed by the earth.  However, the waves
        that reach the ionosphere (a layer of charged particles circling the earth at a height of 100-500 km)
        are refracted by it and sent back to earth.  Amateur radio operators (hams) use these bands to
        talk long distance.



- Microwave Transmission

    - Above 100 MHz, waves travel in nearly straight lines and can be narrowly focused.  Concentrating all
        the energy into a small beam with a parabolic antenna (like the familiar satellite tv dish) gives
        a much higher signal-to-noise ratio, but the transmitting and receiving antennas must be
        accurately aligned with each other.

    - This directionality means that multiple transmitters lined up in a row can communicate with multiple
        receivers in a row without interference.

    - Before fiber optics, for decades these microwaves formed the heart of the long-distance telephone
        transmission system.  In fact, MCI (Microwave Communications, Inc.) was one of AT&T's first
        competitors after it was deregulated, and it built its entire system with microwave communications
        passing between towers tens of kms apart.

    - Microwaves are directional.  If towers are too far apart, the earth will get in the way, repeaters
        are needed periodically.  The taller the towers, the farther apart they can be.

    - Microwaves do not pass through buildings well.  Also, when waves are refracted off of atmospheric
        layers, they may arrive out of phase with the direct wave, an effect known as 'multipath fading'.

    - Microwave communication is widely used for long-distance telephone, mobile phones, television
        distribution, and other purposes where a severe shortage of spectrum has developed.  Key advantages
        over fiber include remvoing the need for right-of-way to lay cables.



- Infrared Transmission

    - Unguided infrared waves are widely used for short-range communication.  Remote controls use this type
        of communication.  They are relatively directional, cheap, and easy to build, but do not pass
        through solid objects.

    - In general, as we go from long-wave radio toward visible light, the waves behave more like light
        and less like radio.

    - The fact that infrared waves do not pass through solid walls can also be a plus.  A system in one
        room won't affect another room, they are difficult to eavesdrop on, and you don't need a government
        license to operate an infrared system.



- Light Transmission

    - Unguided optical signaling has been in use for centuries (think Paul Revere).  A more modern
        application is to connect the LANs in 2 buildings via lasers mounted on their rooftops.  Optical
        signaling using lasers is inherently unidirectional, so each end needs its own laser and its own
        photodetector.

    - This scheme offers very high bandwidth at a very low cost, and it is relatively secure since it is
        difficult to tap a laser beam.  It's easy to install, and doesn't require an FCC license.  However,
        the beam has to be aimed extremely precisely, and lasers cannot penetrate rain or thick fog.  This
        is not an issue when they are used to connect 2 spacecraft.
