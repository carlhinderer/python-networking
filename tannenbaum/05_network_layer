- IPv4 Addresses

    - Every host and router on the internet has an IP address (32-bit in IPv4).  IP packets have a
        'source address' and 'destination address'.


    - Actually, an IP address refers to a network interface, not a host.  Since most hosts are on one
        network, they have one IP address.  However, routers have multiple interfaces and multiple IP
        addresses.



- Prefixes

    - IP addresses are hierarchical, unlike Ethernet addresses.  Each 32-bit address has a 
        variable-length network portion, followed by a host portion.

      The network portion has the same value for all hosts on a single network (such as an Ethernet
         LAN).  This means that a network corresponds to a contiguous block of IP addresses called a
         'prefix'.


    - Addresses have 4 segments, each with a value 0-255.  This is known as 'dotted decimal notation'.

        128.208.2.151


    - Prefixes are written by giving the lowest IP address of the block and the size of the block.  The
        size is determined by the number of bits in the network portion.

      By convention, the IP address has a slash, followed by the number of bits in the network portion.

        128.208.2.0/24


    - Since the prefix length cannot be determined from the IP address alone, routing protocols must
        also include the prefix.


    - The length of the prefix corresponds to a binary mask of 1s in the network portion.  When written
        out this way, it is called a 'subnet mask'.  It can be AND'ed with the IP address to extract
        only the network portion.

        255.255.255.0


    - Advantages of Hierarchical Routing

        1. Routers can forward packets based only on the network portion of the address.  The host
             portion can be ignored, since all packets to the same network will be sent in the same
             direction.

           This makes routing tables much smaller than they would normally be.  Modern routers only need
             about 300K entries in their routing tables.


    - Disadvantages of Hierarchical Routing

        1. The IP address of a host depends on where it is located in the network.  IP addresses are 
             unable to move between networks.


        2. The hierarchy of addresses is wasteful unless carefully managed.  Large blocks of addresses
             were allocated, then left unused.  Explosive growth of the internet rapidly depleted the
             address space.



- Subnets

    - Routing by prefix requires all hosts on a network to have the same network number.  This can 
        cause problems as networks grow, for instance if separate departments of a company want to
        use the same block of addresses.


    - The solution is to allow the block of addresses to be split into several parts for internal use 
        as multiple networks, while still acting like a single network to the outside world.

      This is called 'subnetting' and the networks (such as Ethernet LANs) that result from dividing up
        a larger network are called 'subnets'.



- Subnetting Example

    - Here, the single /16 has been split into pieces.  The split does not need to be even.

        - Half of the block (a /17) is allocated to the CS department.
        - A quarter (a /18) is allocated to the EE department.
        - An eighth (a /19) is allocated to the Art department.
        - An eighth remains unallocated.


        EE   28.208.0.0/18        \

        CS   128.208.128.0/17    --->   128.208.0.0/16    To Internet

        Art  128.208.96.0/19      /


    - To route packets, the router needs to figure out which subnet to send them to.  They could just
        keep 65,536 entries for each host on campus, but we wouldn't get the benefit of hierarchical
        routing.

      Instead, the router just needs to know the subnet masks for the networks on campus.


    - Outside the network, subnetting is not viable, so allocating a new subnet does not require
        contacting ICANN or changing any external databases.



- CIDR (Classless InterDomain Routing)

    - Even if blocks of IP addresses are allocated efficiently, we still have a problem with routing 
        table explosion.


    - Routers in organizations at the edge of a network need to have an entry for each of their
        subnets specifying which line to use to get to that network.  For packets destined for outside 
        the network, they can just send it in the direction of the ISP.


    - Routers in ISPs and backbones don't have these luxuries.  They must know how to get to every
        single network, and there is no default.  Since there are more than a million networks
        connected to the internet, and each packet must perform a lookup in the table, this has
        significant cost.  This is known as the 'default-free zone'.

      Also, routers must share their routing tables with each other, and this becomes more expensive
        as the tables get bigger.


    - To help alleviate this problem, we can use the same insight we used with subnetting: routers at
        different locations can know about a given IP address as belonging to prefixes of different
        sizes.

      Instead of splitting an address block into subnets, we can combine multiple small prefixes into
        a single larger prefix.  This is known as 'route aggregation'.


    - With route aggregation, IP addresses are contained in prefixes of different sizes.  The same IP
        address can be treated by one router as /22, while another router treats it as /20.  It's
        up to each router to to have the corresponding prefix information.

      This design works with subnetting and is called 'CIDR'.



- CIDR Example

    - We have a block of 8192 IP addresses, starting at 192.24.0.0.


    - The address block is divided up among Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Oxford Universities like this:

        University     First address     Last address     How many     Prefix
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Cambridge      194.24.0.0        194.24.7.255     2048         194.24.0.0/21
        Edinburgh      194.24.8.0        194.24.11.255    1024         194.24.8.0/22
        (Available)    194.24.12.0       194.24.15.255    1024         194.24.12.0/22
        Oxford         194.24.16.0       194.24.31.255    4096         194.24.16.0/20


    - The London router notices this split, and combines the 3 prefixes into a single aggregate entry
        for the prefix '194.24.0.0/19' and passes it to the New York router.

                                                         /   192.24.0.0/21   ->   Cambridge
        New York   ->    (192.24.0.0/19)   ->   London   -   192.24.16.0/20  ->   Oxford
                                                         \   192.24.8.0/22   ->   Edinburgh


    - When turned on, this is an automated process.  Aggregation is heavily used throughout the
        Internet and can reduce the size of router tables to around 200,000 prefixes.



- Classful and Special Addressing

    - Before 1993 (and CIDR), IP addresses were divided into five categories.

        A   1.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255  (24 bits for host)

        B   128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255  (16 bits for host)

        C   192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255  (8 bits for host)

        D   224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255  (Multicast)

        E   240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255  (Reserved for future use)


    - Multicast internet is just now starting to be used.


    - Note that class E addresses would be valuable space these days, but it can't be used since so 
        many hosts won't recognize the addresses.


    - For most organizations, a class A address (16 million addresses) is way too big.  A class C
        address (256 addresses) is way too small.  A class B address (65,526 addresses) is just
        right.

      For this reason, everyone wanted a class B, but there are only 16,384 class B addresses.


    - To handle this problem, subnets were introduced.  Later, CIDR was added to reduce the size of
        the global routing table.  Today, the bits that indicate the class of the IP address are
        A, B, and C are no longer used.



- Special Addresses

    - The address '0.0.0.0' is used by hosts when they are being booted.  It means 'this network' or
        'this host'.


    - IP addresses with '0' as their network number refer to the current network.  It allows machines
        to refer to their own network without knowing it's number.


    - The address '255.255.255.255' is used to mean all hosts on the indicated network.  It is used
        for broadcast on a LAN.


    - Addresses with a network number, plus all 1's in the host field, can broadcast packets to any
        distant network on the internet.  However, this is usually disabled by admins for security
        reasons.


    - All addresses of the form '127.x.x.x' are reserved for loopback testing.  Packets sent to that
        address are not put on the wire.  They are processed locally and treated as incoming packets.
