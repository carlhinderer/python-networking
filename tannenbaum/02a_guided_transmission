-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Guided Transmission Media

    - The purpose of the physical layer is to transport bits from one machine to another.  Transmission
        media that rely on a physical cable or wire is called 'guided transmission media' because the
        transmissions are guided along the path of the wire.

    - Each type of guided media has its own set of trade-offs in terms of frequency, bandwidth, delay,
        cost, and ease of installation and maintenance.  Bandwidth is measured in Hz.



- Persistent Storage

    - One way to transport data from one machine to another is to put it on persistent storage and physically
        move the tape or disks to the destination machine.  The bandwidth with this approach is excellent,
        but the delay is long.

    - An industry standard Ultrium tape can hold 30 TB.  Sending a box of tapes across the country in 24
        hours is faster than any computer network.  They cost about $40, and can be reused at least 10
        times.

    - For moving very large amounts of data, this is often the best solution.  AWS's 'Snowmobile' is an
        example of this.



- Twisted Pairs

    - Twisted pair is one of the oldest and most common transmission media.  A 'twisted pair' consists of
        2 insulated copper wires, typically about 1 mm thick.  Whereas 2 parallel wires make a good antenna,
        when the wires are twisted, the waves cancel each other out.

    - A signal is carried as the difference in voltage between the 2 wires.  Transmitting the signal as
        the difference between the 2 voltage levels, as opposed to an absolute voltage, provides better
        immunity to external noise.

    - The most common application of twisted pair is in the telephone system.  Nearly all telephones are
        connected to the telco office by a twisted pair.  Both telephone calls and ASDL internet access
        run over these lines.

    - Twisted pairs can run several km without amplification, but for longer distance the signal becomes
        too attenuated and repeaters are needed.  When many twisted pairs run in parallel for a substantial
        distance, such as all the wires from an apartment building to the telco office, they are bundled
        together in a protective sheath.

    - Twisted pairs can be used for transmitting either analog or digital information.  The bandwidth
        depends on the distance and thickness of the wires, but hundreds of MB/s can be achieved for a few
        km.

    - Twisted pair-cabling comes in several varieties.  A common variety is Category 5e, which has 4 pairs
        twisted gently and grouped together in a plastic sheath.

    - Different LAN standards use the twisted pairs differently.  For instance, 100-Mbps Ethernet uses 2 of
        the 4 pairs, one for each direction.  1-Gbps Ethernet uses all 4 pairs in both directions
        simultaneously, which requires the receiver to factor out the signal that is transmitted.

    - Links that can be used in both directions at the same time are called 'full-duplex' links.  Links
        that can be used in either direction, but only one direction at a time, are called 'half-duplex'
        links.  Links that can only be used in one direction are called 'simplex' links.

    - The earlier Cat 3 was replaced by Cat 5, which has more twists per meter, resulting in less crosstalk
        and better-quality signal over long distances.  Some cables in Cat 6 and Cat 7 and above can support
        10-Gbps links often found in new office buildings.  Cat 8 has higher speeds but distances only up to 
        30 m, so it is only used in data centers.

    - Through Cat 6, these cables are referred to as UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) since they simply consist
        of wires and insulators.  Cat 7 cables haved shielding on the individual twisted pairs, which
        reduces crosstalk.



- Coaxial Cable

    - 'Coaxial cable' has better shelding and greater bandwidth, so it can span longer distances with
        higher speeds than twisted pair.

    - Two kinds of coaxial cable are widely used.  One kind, 50-ohm cable, is commonly used when it is
        intended for digital transmission from the start.

    - The other kind, 75-ohm, is commonly used for analog transmission and cable television.  This is for
        historical reasons, as it was easy to interoperate with early dipole 300-ohm antennas using 4:1
        impedance-matching transformers.  Starting in the 1990s, cable TV operators began to provide
        internet access over cable, making 75-ohm more important for data communication.

    - A coaxial cable consists of a stiff copper wire as the core, surrounded by an insulating material.
        The insulator is encased by a cylindrical conductor, often as a closely woven braided mesh.  The
        outer conductor is covered in a protective plastic sheath.

    - The construction and shielding of the coax cable gie it a good combination of high bandwidth and
        excellent noise immunity.  The bandwidth depends on the cable quality and length.  Modern cables
        have a bandwidth up to 6 GHz, allowing many conversations to be transferred over a single coax
        cable (a single tv signal might use 3.5 MHz).

    - Coax cables were once widely used within the telephone system, but have now been widely replaced by
        fiber optics on long haul routes.  It is still widely used for cable tv, MANs, and for delivering
        high-speed Internet connectivity to homes.



- Power Lines

    - Besides telephone and cable television networks, electrical power lines can also be reused for data
        communications.  Power lines have been used for low-rate communication like remote metering for
        many years and in home to control devices (the X10 standard).  In recent years, there has been
        renewed interest in high-rate communication over these lines.

    - The most common scenario is using electrical wires inside the home.  This is convenient, since you
        can just plug a device into the outlet and also receive data connectivity.

    - The difficulty is that electrical wiring was designed to distribute power signals, not data signals.
        Electrical signals are sent as 50-60 Hz and much higher frequency signals are needed for data
        communication.

    - Despite the difficulties, it is practical to send at least 500 Mbps short distances over typical
        household wiring.



- Fiber Optics

    - In 1981, the original IBM PC ran at 4.77 MHz, and 40 years later, PCs could run a 4-core CPU at 3 GHz,
        a 2500x improvement.  Similarly, wide area communication links went from 45 Mbps (a T3 line with the
        telephone system) to 100 Gpbs (a modern long-distance line), a 2000x improvement.

    - The achievable bandwidth with fiber technology is 50 Tbps, and we are nowhere near reaching these
        limits.  The current practical limit of 100 Gbps is due to our inability to convert between
        electrical and optical signals any faster.  To build higher-capacity links, many channels are
        carried in parallel over a single fiber.

    - Fiber optics are used for long-haul transmission lines in network backbones, high-speed LANs, and 
        and high-speed Internet access such as fiber to the home.

    - An optical transmission system has 3 key components - the light source, the transmission medium,
        and the detector.  Conventially, a pulse of light indicates 1 and the absence of light indicates 0.
        The transmission medium is an ultra-thin fiber of glass.  The detector generates an electrical
        pulse when light falls on it.  

    - By attaching a light source at one end of the fiber and a detector at the other end, we get a simplex 
        data transmission system that accepts an electrical signal, converts and transmits it via light
        pulses, and then reconverts the output to an electrical signal at the receiving end.

    - Due to physical principles of how light rays are refracted when they pass from one medium to another
        (for example, from glass to air), light rays can propogate for many km with virtually no loss.

    - Since a light ray will be reflected internally, many different rays will be bouncing around at
        different angles.  Each ray is said to have a different mode, so a fiber having this property is
        known as 'multimode fiber'.  If the fiber's diameter is reduced to a few wavelengths of light
        (10 micros vs 50 microns for multimode), light can only propogate in a straight line, yielding
        'single-mode fiber'.

    - Single-mode fibers are more expensive, but are widely used for longer distances.  They can transmit
        signals 50x farther than multimode fibers (100 Gpbs over 100 km is practical).

    - Optical fiber is made from glass, which is made from sand.  Glassmaking was known to ancient Egyptians.
        Glass transparent enough to be used for windows (< 1mm thick) was invented during the Renaissance.
        Glass used for modern optical fibers is so transparent that if the oceans were filled with it, you 
        could see the seabed from the surface.

    - The near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum is used for light transmission.  3 wavelength
        bands are most commonly used - 0.85, 1.30, and 1.55 microns.

    - Fiber-optic cables are similar to coax, except without the braid.  The glass core is surrounded by
        a glass cladding used to keep all light in the core.  Fibers are typically grouped in bundles,
        protected by an outer sheath.

    - Terrestrial fiber sheaths are normally laid on the ground within a meter of th esurface.  Near the
        shore, transoceanic fiber sheaths are buried in trenches by a knd of seaplow.  In deep water, they
        just lie on the bottom.

    - Fibers can be connected with connectors (20% light loss), spliced mechanically by making careful cuts
        (10% light loss), or fused together (almost as good as single drawn fiber).

    - Either LEDs or semiconductor lasers can be used as light sources.  Photodiodes are used as the
        receivers.



- Fiber Optics vs Copper Wire

    - Fiber can handle much higher bandwidths and have far lower attenuation, requiring fewer repeaters
        over long distances.  Fiber is not affected by power surges, electromagnetic interference,
        power failures, or corrosive chemicals in the air.

    - Telephone companies like fiber, because it is thin and lightweight.  Many existing cable ducts are
        full, and there is no room to add capacity.  Removing all copper and replacing it with fiber
        empties the ducts, and the copper has excellent resale value.

    - Fibers do not leak light and are difficult to tap, giving it good security properties against
        eavesdroppers.

    - Fiber is less familiar, and requires skills that are harder to find.  Fibers can be easily damaged
        by being bent too much.  Also, fiber is more expensive.
