- CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)

    - A large collection of servers is distributed around the world.  Content, ranging from static files
        to streaming video, is replicated in many locations across a single CDN.

    - When a user requests content, the CDN must decide which replica it should serve to the user based
        on geographic location, load on the CDN server, and traffic and congestion on the network.

    - Large content provides like Google, Amazon, Netflix operate their own CDNs.  Some CDNs, like
        Akamai and Cloudflare, operate their own CDNs.



- Transit Networks

    - Typically, content and applications are hosted in data-center networks.  You are accessing content
        from an access network.  Content must traverse the Internet from the data center to the access
        network.

    - When the content provider and your ISP are not directly connected, they rely on a transit network
        to carry the traffic between them.  Transit networks typically charge both the ISP and the
        content provider for carrying traffic from end to end.

    - If the network hosting the content and the access network exchange enough traffic, they may decide
        to interconnect directly.  For instance, large ISPs connect directly to Google and Netflix, using
        infrastructure built for this purpose.

    - Transit networks are traditionally called 'backbone networks'.  This used to be a hugely
        profitable business, but the expansion of huge content providers and huge ISPs has led to less
        reliance on backbones and more on direct interconnections between content providers and ISPs.



- Enterprise Networks

    - Companies need to connect many offices and resources together.  Networks called VPNs connect the
        individual networks at different sites into one logical network.

    - Telephone calls are now commonly made using computer networks.  This is called 'IP Telephony' or
        'VOIP'.



- PANs (Personal Access Networks)

    - PANs let devices used by a single person communicate with each other.  For instance, a computer
        connects with it's peripherals.

    - While a monitor is typically attached with a cable, many other peripherals now use Bluetooth, a
        short-range wireless network, to connect these peripherals without wires.



- LANs

    - A LAN is a private network that operates within a single building, such as a home, office, or
        factory.

    - Wireless LANs are pervasive today.  Each computer has a radio modem and an antenna it uses to
        connect to other computers.  In most cases, each computer talks to a device called an AP (Access
        Point), wireless router, or base station.  This device relays packets between the wireless
        computers and the internet.

    - In a 'Mesh Network', devices relay packets between one another.  These are common in developing
        regions where deploying connectivity is difficult or costly.

    - The IEEE 802.11 standard, also known as 'WiFi', is the most popular standard for wireless
        communications.

    - Wired LANs use many different transmission technologies.  Common physical modes of transportation
        are copper, coaxial cable, and optical fiber.  Since they have limited size, worst-case
        transmission time is bounded and transmission errors are infrequent.

    - IEEE 802.3, aka 'Ethernet', is by far the most common type of wired LAN.  In a 'Switched Ethernet'
        network, each computer speaks the Ethernet protocol and connects to a device called a 'switch'
        with a point-to-point link.  The switch relays packets between computers that are attached to it,
        using the address in each packet to determine which computer to send it to.

    - A switch has multiple ports, each of which can connect to one other device.  To build larger LANs,
        switches can be plugged into each other using their ports.  If they are plugged together in a 
        loop, they will still work, thanks to an anti-looping algorithm.

    - It is possible to divide one large physical LAN into several smaller logical LANs, for instance to
        separate departments of a company.  These are called VLANs (Virtual LANs).

    - 'Classic Ethernet', the original Ethernet design, broadcasted all packets over a single cable.
        Only one machine could transmit at a time, and a distributed arbitration mechanism was used to
        resolve conflicts.  If two packets collided, each computer just waited a random time and tried
        again later.



- Home Networks

    - Home networks, a specific type of LAN, may now consist of many different types of devices connected
        together.  The IoT adds lots of potential devices to a single network.

    - Even though the home network is just another LAN, it has some different properties.  Devices need
        to be easy for anyone to install and maintain.  Security and reliability have high stakes for
        consumer health and safety.  There is a diverse set of devices connected to the network, as 
        opposed to a more homogenous corporate network, and legacy devices are connected for many years.
        Also, profit margins are small, which may lead to security and reliability being an afterthought.

    - 'Power-line Networks' let devices that plug into outlets broadcast information throughout the house.
        You plug a TV into the wall, and both power and data signals are sent at the same time.



- MANs (Metropolitan Area Networks)

    - A MAN covers a city.  The best known examples are cable television networks.  Until the late 1990s,
        these were intended for television channel reception only.

    - When the Internet began attracting a large audience, cable providers started providing two-way
        Internet service with the unused parts of the spectrum.

                        / Junction Box
        Cable Head-End  - Junction Box / House
                        \ Junction Box - House
                                       \ House

    - Recent developments in high-speed wireless Internet access has resulted in another type of MAN,
        defined as IEEE 802.16 (commonly called 'WiMAX').



- WANs

    - A WAN spans a large geographical area, like a country, or even multiple continents.  It may serve
        a private organization (an enterprise WAN) or it may be a commercial offering (transit network).

    - We may have branch offices in different cities, and we want to connect all the computers in these
        offices ('hosts') together.  The network that connects these hosts together is called the
        communication subnet ('subnet').

    - In most WANs, the subnet consists of transmission lines (which move bits around), usually leased
        from a telecomms company, and switching elements, which connect transmission lines.  The most
        commonly used name for these switching elements is 'router'.

    - The network decides which path to use to connect transmission lines using a 'routing algorithm'.
        How each router decides where to send a packet next is called a 'forwarding algorithm'.

    - Composite networks that connect more than one network are called 'internetworks'.



- VPNs and SD-WANs

    - Instead of leasing dedicated transmission lines, an organization might rely on Internet connectivity
        to connect it's offices.  This is called a VPN.  This provides a lot of flexibility, but there is
        a lack of control over the underlying resources.

    - Satellite networks are a type of WAN.  They are most useful when broadcast is important or no
        ground-based infrastructure is present.

    - The cellular telephone network is another type of WAN.
        - 1G = Analog and voice only
        - 2G = Digital and voice only
        - 3G = Digital for voice and data
        - 4G = Purely digital, even for voice
        - 5G = Faster and lower delays

    - More recently, organizations are using SD-WANs (Software-Defined WANs) to connect disjoint sites.
        This is an example of SDNs (Software-Defined Networks), which describe network architecture
        using a combination of programmable switches.



- Internetworks

    - A collection of interconnected networks, each using different technologies, is an 'internet'.  The
        global 'Internet' is the largest internet.

    - The device that makes a connection between networks and provides the necessary hardware and
        software translation is a 'gateway'.  Gateways are distinguished by layer at which they operate
        in the protocol hierarchy.  Generally, an internet will be connected by network-layer gateways.



- History of the Internet

    - The Internet is a vast collection of different networks that use common protocols and provide
        common services.  For a history of how it came about, read 'How the Internet Happened' by
        Brian McCullough.

    - In the late 1950s, the US DOD wanted a command-and-control network that could survive a nuclear
        war.  At the time, all military communications used the public telephone network, which was
        considered vulnerable due to it's hierarchical nature.  Paul Baran at the RAND Corporation 
        suggested a packet-switched network, but the idea went nowhere.

    - After Sputnik (1957), President Eisenhower created a single defense research organization, ARPA
        (Advanced Research Projects Agency) to fund projects across branches of the military.  In
        1967, a proposal was made to revive the packet-switching idea.  A store-and-foward design with
        interconnected hosts was designed.

    - An experimental network went online in 1969 with nodes at UCLA, UCSB, SRI, and the University of
        Utah.  3 years later, the network spanned the entire USA.  ARPA also funded research on using 
        satellite and mobile packet radio networks.  A famous experiment was conducted where a truck
        driving through CA used the radio network to send messages over ARPANET to the east coast, where
        they were relayed over satellite to a network in London.

    - This experiment demonstrated that the ARPANET protocols were not meant to run over different 
        networks, so TCP/IP was invented (1974) and funded.  TCP/IP was specifically designed to handle
        communication over internetworks.  ARPA funded contracts to implement TCP/IP on different
        computer platforms - IBM, DEC, HP, and Berkeley UNIX.

    - Researchers at UCB rewrote TCP/IP with a new programming interface called 'sockets'.  They also
        wrote many application, utility, and management programs to show how convenient sockets was
        to use.  This complete package was adopted by many universities immediately.

    - In the late 1970s, the National Science Foundation funded NSFNET to facilitate university research.
        A network was built out with a backbone and regional networks, and it connected to ARPANET.
        Fiber-optic channels were leased from MCI and communication speeds rapidly improved.  By 1990,
        the second NSFNET backbone was upgraded to 1.5 Mbps.

    - As growth continued, NSF realized government couldn't keep funding it, and commercial organizations
        wanted to get involved.  MERIT, MCI, and IBM formed a nonprofit corporation called ANS (Advanced
        Networks and Services).  In 1990, ANS took over NSFNET and upgraded links to 45 Mbps to form
        ANSNET.  This network operated for 5 years and was then sold to America Online.  The government
        got out of the networking business.

    - To ease the transition and make sure regional networks could communicate with each other, NSF
        awarded contracts to 4 different network operators to establish a NAP (Network Access Point).
        - PacBell (San Francisco)
        - Ameritech (Chicago)
        - MFS (Washington DC)
        - Sprint (NYC)

    - This arrangement meant that each regional network had a choice of backbone carriers, and the
        backbone carriers were forced to compete on service and price, leading to an explosion of
        commercially-driven competitive architecture.



- The Internet Architecture

    - A common method for connecting to the Internet from your home is to send signals over cable TV
        infrastructure.  The cable network, sometimes called an 'HFC' (Hybrid Fiber-Coaxial), is a
        single integrated infrastructure that uses a packet-based transport called 'DOCSIS' (Data Over
        Cable Service Interface Spec).  This spec is used to transmit television channels, high-speed
        data, and voice.

    - The device at the home end is called a 'cable modem' (a modulator-demodulator converts between
        digital bits and analog signals).  The device at the cable headend is called the 'CMTS'
        (Cable Modem Termination System).

    - Access networks are limited by the 'last mile' or last leg of transmission.  The most recent
        standard, DOCSIS 3.1, allows for full duplex (symmetric upstream and downstream rates) with
        a maximum capacity of 10 Gbps.

    - Another option for last-mile deployment is 'FTTH' (Fiber to the Home).  For businesses in 
        commercial areas, it may make sense to lease a dedicated high-speed transmission line.  In large
        cities, leased lines of up to 10 Gbps are available.  A T3 line runs at roughly 45 Mbps.

    - We call the location at which customer packets enter the ISP network the 'POP' (Point of Presence).
        From this point on, the system is fully digital and packet-switched.

    - ISP networks may be regional, national, or international.  The architecture that includes long-distance
        transmission lines that interconnect routers and different POPs in different cities is called
        the 'backbone' of the ISP.  If a packet is sent to a host on a different ISP, it must be handed
        over to a different ISP.

    - ISPs connect their networks to exchange traffic at 'IXPs' (Internet Exchange Points).  The connected
        ISPs are said to 'peer' with each other.  IXPs (buildings full of routers) are placed in cities
        around the world.  A very fast optical LAN inside the building connects all the routers.  IXPs
        can be large and independently owned facitilies that compete for business.  For instance, the
        Amsterdam Internet Exchange exchanges 4 TB of traffic per second.

    - The path a packet takes through the Internet depends on the peering choices of the ISPs.  Often, the
        path a packet takes is not the shortest, but rather the least congested or cheapest.

    - A small handful of 'transit providers', including AT&T and Level 3, operate large international
        backbone networks with thousands of routers connected by high-bandwidth fiber-optic links.  These
        ISPs are called Tier-1 ISPs and form the backbone of the Internet.  They do not pay for transit.

    - Companies that provide lots of content (ie Facebook and Netflix) locate their servers in data centers
        that are well-connected to the rest of the internet.  These data centers have 'server farms' with
        many racks of servers.  It is now common to rent a VM in a server farm instead of running your own
        computer.

    - Conventionally, the Internet has been viewed as a hierarchy, with Tier-1 providers at the top of the
        hierarchy.  Over the past decade, this hierarchy has flattened dramatically with the rise of giant
        content providers (ie Google, Netflix, Twitch, Amazon) and globally distributed CDNs (ie Akamai,
        Limelight, and Cloudflare).  Whereas in the past, content providers had to rely on transit
        networks to deliver content to local ISPs, both the access ISPs and content providers have become
        so large that they often connect directly to each other in many distinct locations.



- Mobile Networks

    - Mobile networks have more than 5 billion subscribers worldwide.  In 2018, they accounted for more
        than half of global Internet traffic.

    - The 'E-UTRAN' (Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network) is the radio communication protocol
        is used over the air between the mobile device and cellular base station (now called an 'eNodeB').
        The air interface is based on CDMA.

    - The cellular base station, together wit its controller, forms the 'radio access network'.  This is
        the wireless part of the mobile phone network.  The controller node ('RNC' or Radio Network
        Controller) controls how the spectrum is used.  The base station implements the air interface.

    - The rest of the mobile phone network carries the traffic for the radio access network.  It is called
        the 'core network'.  In 4G, the core network became packet-switched, and is now called the
        'EPC' (Evolved Packet Core).  This evolved from earlier GSM core systems.

    - Now that data services are provided, the UMTS core network nodes connect directly to a packet-switched
        network.  The S-GW (Serving Network Gateway) and P-GW (Packet Data Network Gateway) deliver data
        packets between mobiles and the Internet.

    - When a user moves out of the range of one cellular base station and into the range of another one,
        the flow of data must be rerouted to the new station.  This is known as a 'handoff'.

    - A related issue is how to find a mobile when there is an incoming call.  Each mobile phone network
        has a HSS (Home Subscriber Server) in the core network that knows the location of each subscriber.
        This way, any mobile can be found by contacting the HSS.

    - Starting the GSM 2G, the mobile phone was divided into a handset and a removable chip containing
        the subscriber's account and identity information.  This chip is called a SIM card (Subscriber
        Identity Module).  SIM cards can be switched to different handsets to activate them.

    - SIM cards are also used for privacy.  Since wireless signals are broadcast to all nearby receivers,
        cryptographic keys on the SIM card are used to encrypt transmission.



- Packet Switching and Circuit Switching

    - Since the beginning of networking, there has been a war between packet-switched networks (which are
        connectionless) and circuit-switched networks (which are connection-oriented).  

    - The Internet community supports packet switching.  Every packet is routed independently.  If a
        router goes down, another path to the destination can be found.  If too many packets arrive at a
        router in a specific time interval, it will lose packets, so the application has to account for
        this and resend missing packets.

    - The telephone community supports circuit switching.  A caller must dial the party's number and wait
        for a connection before talking or sending data.  This connection establishes a route through
        the telephone system that is maintained until the cal is terminated.  If a line or switch on the
        path goes down, the call is aborted.  Circuit switching makes it easier to support QoS.



- Generations of Mobile Networks

    - 1G mobile phone systems transmitted phone calls as continuously varying (analog) signals.  AMPS,
        deployed in the USA in 1982, was a widely used example.

    - 2G systems switched to transmitting voice calls in digital form to incease capacity, improve
        security, and offer text messaging.  GSM, deployed starting in 1991, has been widely used
        worldwide.

    - 3G systems, initially deployed in 2001, offer both digital voice and broadband digital services.
        UMTS is the main 3G system that is deployed worldwide.

    - The scarce resource in these systems is radio spectrum.  Governments auctioned off spectrum for
        billions of dollars.  To manange manage radio interference between users, users in a coverage
        area are divided into cells and assigned channels that don't interfere with each other.  This
        makes for good frequency reuse.

    - 4G and 4G LTE networks emerged in the late 2000s, and quickly became the dominant mode of mobile
        Internet access.

    - 5G networks are able to offer much higher speeds by operating in much higher frequency bands (6 GHz
        vs 20 MHz for 4G).  The challenge is that higher frequency signals do not travel as far as lower
        frequencies, so the signal must account for signal attenuation and interference.  Methods of
        doing this include MIMO antenna arrays.



- Wireless Networks

    - The first attempt at creating a standard for wireless internet was published as 802.11 in the mid
        1990s, commonly called 'WiFi'.

    - The desire to find a suitable frequency band that was available worldwide let to unlicensed bands
        such as the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) bands.

    - 802.11 networks have clients and infrastructure called Access Points, which connect to the wired
        network.

    - There are many WiFi standards which use the available spectrum in various ways, including hopping
        between frequencies or spreading the signal across the allowed spectrum.

    - Since wireless is inherently a broadcast medium, 802.11 radios also have to deal with the problem
        of collisions.  To handle this problem, CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) is used.  
        Computers wait for a short random interval before transmitting and defer their transmissions if
        someone else is already transmitting.  After a collision, a sender waits another, longer random
        delay before transmitting.

    - Since wireless transmissions are broadcast, it is easy for nearby computers to receive packets
        that weren't met for them.  To prevent this, the 802.11 standard included an encryption scheme
        called WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy).  This was followed by later standards WPA (Wifi Protected
        Access) and WPA2.  More sophisticated protocols, such as 802.1X allow certificate-based 
        authentication of the access point to the client.
